ResumAI is a comprehensive document analysis platform that leverages AI to extract insights, generate summaries, and provide interactive question-answering capabilities for PDF documents.

## üöÄ Features

- **Document Management**: Upload, view, and manage PDF documents in a clean interface
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automatically generate summaries, key topics, and insights
- **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions about your documents and get intelligent answers
- **Semantic Search**: Find documents related to specific topics or questions
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized user experience across desktop and mobile devices

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ResumAI uses a modern stack with separate frontend and backend services:

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **UI Framework**: Next.js with React and TypeScript

- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context API
- **API Communication**: Axios for REST API calls

### Backend (NestJS)
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector embeddings
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for document analysis
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Document Processing**: PDF parsing and text extraction

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (with pgvector extension)
- Redis
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### Running the Application
